# 🗂️ ATD – All Tech Development Repository

## Overview
ATD is my **master repository** where I save and organize all my coding files, demos, and projects.  
It includes work across **C++**, **Python**, **cloud automation**, **IoT hardware**, and **AI/ML experiments**.

  Tech: Arduino, GPS Module, ESP8266, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
  → Real-time patient tracking with geo-fencing alerts.

- **Rapid CPR Machine**  
  Tech: Arduino, Pressure Sensor, Pulse Sensor, ESP8266, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase  
  → Web app showing CPR compression depth, rate, and vitals.

- **AI Satellite – Orbital Mechanics & Stability Analysis**  
  Tech: Python, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Plotly  
  → Simulated orbital decay and stability using classical mechanics + ML.

- **Quantum Information Security**  
  Tech: Python, Qiskit, Cryptography, Plotly  
  → Quantum key distribution (BB84), post-quantum cryptography, and visualization.

## Purpose
This repository acts as my **personal coding archive**:
- Every project I build or experiment with is stored here.
- Serves as a **portfolio** to showcase my technical growth.
- Provides reusable code snippets and references for future work.

---

## References
Each project folder contains its own README with references (books, papers, documentation).  
For example:
- Vallado & Curtis for orbital mechanics.  
- NOAA & NASA reports for satellite drag/stability.  
- Nielsen & Chuang for quantum information.  
- Scikit-learn & Plotly documentation for ML and visualization.

## Future Work
- Add more **AI + IoT integrations**.  
- Expand **mobile app development** projects.  
- Document **cloud automation workflows**.
